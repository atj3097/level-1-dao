# Level 1  
### A fun and friendly learning and development platform designed for decentralized communities to tap into the full awesomeness of their membership. 
### Watch our presentation explaining Level 1 more in depth here here -> [Video](https://youtu.be/labhduL_v0Y)
### Our DApp is currently live on Rinkeby Testnet. Check out the *Gitcoin DAO Tools* onboarding course under the 'Discover' tab -> [Level 1 DApp](https://level1.vercel.app/)

## Fast Follows Before Mainnet Launch

### Building A Gasless DApp for users  
We would imagine that your first thought after learning about a platform with onboarding users through a Learn2Earn model was "What about the gas fees?". We weren't able to cram this into the scope of the hackathon, but we are doing a fast follow on this for a mainnet launch. We are currently working on incorparating GSN(Gas Station Network), to create a gasless experience for our users. This is a major drawback to our platform currently and definitely serves as our top priority.

### Level 1 Mobile App 
While our platform is catered towards people already in Web3, we recognize that a huge userbase is being left out by not having a mobile component for a platform like this. Our current UI does transfer well to the MetaMask mobile app, however native mobile applications will allow us to leverage a better user experience for users.  

### Unlock Discord Channels Through Our Level 1 NFT 
We are working towards building a discord bot that allows users to be recognized for their Level1 accomplishments through unlocked community discord channels and Level1 activity feed channels.

### User accounts, profile pages, commenting, high fives, and other Web2 type functionality
We have the schema and the tech stack defined for these items and plan to implement over the next few weeks. Our focus for the hackathon was shaping out the idea and implementing Web3 functionality.

## Security Concerns 
Our main concern was around preventing users from abusing the Learn2Earn model to earn more tokens than they're allowed to win.


There's about 3 layers of protection we can take to prevent this happening. The first is making sure we have an air tight UI to prevent users from being able to trigger transactions more than once. The next layer would be having a check in our Learn2Earn contract to ensure a wallet address hasn't taken a course before. However, what if someone just switches their wallet to get more level 1 tokens? This is where our ideas surrounded by tokenomics come in. While we don't want the Level 1 Tokens to be worthless, we will have to have tokenomics in place that essentially don't incentivze bad actors to sit through our courses multiple times to rack up on Level 1 tokens. 
Some ideas we have considered for our tokenomics/ux
- Burning Level 1 tokens after a wallet has exceeded a pre-determined token ownership limit. (sum of all token awards from courses)
- Minting Level 1 tokens at a frequeny that cause for there to be a low incentive to hold the tokens for a long time. This inflationary practice will allow Level 1 tokens to not necessarily be "worthless", but rather it will make gaming our system not worth the effort. 


## Level 1 Token 
We know, we know. *Another* cryptocurrency, the last thing we want to is make this a moonshot project! Level1 token will convert to a governance token as we move towards decentralized ownership. Level1 tokens are issued to learners and guides. We believe these folx are in the best position to shape the direction of the platform.

## Level 1 NFT  
The Level 1 NFT serves as a point of reference for users to have proof of having finished a particular course on website. NFTs awarded can unlock Discord channels and maintain a learners momentum by recognizing them for their accomplishments. We also find it a great way to create a community within Level1 and hope to be able to show people others who have collected a numbered version of the NFT.
