# Mission
A low-stakes space for people to learn from each other.

# Vision
A world where learning something new is comfortable.

# Values
- **Safe:**
In order for learning to occur, learners must feel safe to explore. This means creating low-stakes environments without worry of judgement, loss, or harm.

- **Guided:**
We learn better together. We prioritize opportunities for humxns to directly help each other over automated experiences.

- **Play:**
Learn by doing helps humxns retain information. Level1 prioritizes interactive self-paced learning experiences.

- **Seen:**
Learners and guides give their most valued resource, time. We see and appreciate this at every point in the Level1 experience.

- **Begin:**
We seek those taking the first steps in their learning journey. We create space for beginner perspectives.

# Hypothesis
Centralized learning platforms allow learners to connect with instructors in a 1 (instructor) to many (students) format. This mimics most top-down education institutions and is familiar to those teaching and learning. This centralized structure, although familiar, is limited in that learnings flow from few to many. This means that the teaching style and biases are projected on to learners. It also means relationships in this 1-to-many format can be superficial as it is difficult for an instructor to maintain meaningful relationships with so many students.

Decentralized learning platforms allow learners to engage with a community in order to learn new skills and perspectives. This allows for a many-to-many learning flow to occur. Many of these learning communities have been established organically, created by the community to fill a particular need. The rules, roles, rewards and content format is often unclear as the community works to define its standard work processes.

Level1 can potentially fill a gap in today's learning landscape by serving those that are not currently served by both centralized and decentralized learning platforms. With a clear mission, vision, and values and rails, players, recognition and level format we should be able to provide a space for people to guide each other through learning journeys across a variety of topics. We hope to be an opinionated decentralized learning platform with clear paths on how folx can inform and update those opinions when needed.

# Players
- **Guides:**
Every Level has a humxn guide. This person has taken the time to curate a set of content that they feel will help folx gain the confidence participate in a particular topic. Guides introduce the level and help learners orient themselves. They provide prompts throughout for learners to share reflections with other learners. Guides can make themselves available for answering learners questions but it is not mandatory. An important function of guides is to provide tools and community space for learners to be able to answer questions they might have now and in the future without relying on a single point of knowledge.

We believe anyone can be a guide on a topic they're passionate about. We provide tools for guides to design compassionate, comfortable, fun learning journeys.

- **Learners:**
The hero of Level1. Learners have taken the big first step to learn about something currently unknown. We recognize that past learning experiences learners carry with them might trigger certain feelings along the way. Our compassion for the energy learners put in during this stage of their journey needs to show at every step.

- **Supporting cast:**
Supporting cast members include designers, developers, advisors and advocates. They are themselves guides and learners and spend time listening and observing these groups in order to make updates to the platform that provide outcomes that the group has agreed are important.

We hope to able to open up the supporting cast to a larger Level1 community once standard working practices have been more defined.

# Rails
- **Cooperative:**
Our focus is on the success of the collective. This means we do not have benchmarks, "leader"boards, tests, quizzes or grades. We stay away from comparisons and use our energy towards celebrating where we are in this moment.

We find polls and reflection prompts help learners learn from each other, which provide improved improved learning outcomes over right/wrong test formats.

- **Accessible:**
Level1 works towards being a space that all can be their best selves within. 
  - This means content is consumable in different languages, regions, and formats including screen readers, dynamic font sizes and high-contrast colors. 
  - Content is bite-sized.
    - Currently this means each component of a learning journey is less than 10 minutes long and a learning journey in total is less than 50 minutes.
  - The entire platform can be navigated via keyboard input only

- **Language:**
We recognize the words we use are powerful. Therefor we are constantly auditing the language used in the platform to ensure it aligns to the mission, vision and values of Level1.
  - Words we try not to use: Master, Class, Lesson, Grade, Results, Expert, Newbie, Noob, Test, Quiz
  - Symbols we don't use: Checkmarks, X
  - Words we find are aligned to mission: Learning journey, Guide, Feelings. 

We frequently audit the platform to remove any performance based language that might find its way in.

- **Witness the power of the learner:**
Every step a learner takes towards learning something new is a powerful one. We build experiences that celebrate how powerful learners are.

- **Everyone can be a guide:**
Any Level1 can be branched. This means Level1 content, that was not originally generated by the guide, can be moved into another Level1. When a Level1 is branched, the inspiration chain is maintained and attributed. This means when a Level1 that Ray created is branched, learners will see that the inspiration of this new Level1 came from Ray's guided Level1.

We will explore ways guides can be rewarded for learning outcomes that happen down the chain.

- **Two-way conversations:**
Every Level1 will have space to create a two-way dialogue. This can be learners providing feedback to guides as well as learners supporting each other.

- **Fun:**
"If it ain't fun, what's the point" - Ben and Jerry's bumper sticker. A measure on if we've created a low-stakes environment is how much fun people are having. Creating space for play, laughter, and experimentation is important to us. Some thoughts we have here revolve around designing forgiving environments. Inspireation from physical play spaces excite us to explore soft edges, plaful mascots, custom themes, easy navigation, undo and saved progress functions.

# Level design
As a guide you are likely passionate about introducing a topic that has brought joy into your life. We encourage you to harness this passion and integrate it into the design of your Level1.

When a learner clicks on your level, the first thing they'll see is the **overview page**. There are a few important elements on this page to take note of.

 <img src="public/assets/screenshots/1.png?raw=true" alt="Level1 Overview Page Screenshot">
</p>

- **Your profile:**
This is displayed to show learners who the guide on the Level is. 
  - We recommend using a name that matches other names you use on other social platforms. We also recommend using a picture of yourself or an avatar that you frequently use on other social platforms.
- **Learning outcomes:**
This is where learners can see what super powers they'll have after completing this Level1. 
  - We recommend a few bullet points that demonstrate understanding of terminology, what resources they'll be able to connect with (including humxns and documentation), and what you hope they'll feel comfortable taking on after completing.
- **Learning journey:**
Learners will be able to see each module in the learning journey.
  - It is important that each module in the learning journey is 5 minutes or less and that the learning journey is 50 minutes or less. This ensures learners maintain their attention and can achieve completion of journey within a day.

When a learner clicks to start a Level1, they are able to navigate through the **learning journey**. Below are important elements of a Level1 learning journey.

<p align="center">

</p>

- **Introduction:**
This should come from the guide. We encourage video whenever possible. 
  - Start with gratitude and appreciate for the learner who has made the choice to go on this journey with you. 
  - Share your story. Why are you passionate about this topic. 
  - Lastly, share how learners can ask questions and get support along the way. 
  
We recognize guides might not have time to answer learner's questions. This is okay. The introduciton is a great space to emphasize that learners can support each other and that they'll be able to get to know other learners along the way as they share their reflections.

- **Content:**
This can be YouTube videos, links to blog posts, reflection prompts or polls.
  - All content should have a note from the guide. We recommend sharing why you chose this content, what you got out of it and things learners could reflect on.
  - YouTube videos should include the start and end timestamp
  - If a blog post is long-format, provide a tl;dr or a particular part of the blog post learners should pay most attention to.
  - Reflection prompts are a question with a free-form text field for learners to fill in
  - Polls provide learners with a few pre-set options and an other fill in the blank option to select from

- **Celebration:**
This is the final part of the Level1 learning journey. It's a great place for a video from the guide to bask in the greatness of the learners. Appreciate the journey they've gone on, recap the learning outcomes and emphasize that others are on this journey with them.
  - At the end of a Level1, learners are shown a look-back at their journey. This includes reflections, questions that they helped answer, high-fives they gave and received. They also are presented with an NFT certificate that memorializes their accomplishment.

Upon completion, learners are able to mint a **Level1 or custom NFT**
We are still working on the optimal format of the NFT. Currently we're thinking MP4, SVG or PNG is suitable. We will work with you to set the NFT up.

---
Learning journeys are ongoing with highs and lows. It's the first steps on that journey that are often the scariest to take but the most meaningful. We remember those that provided us safety when taking the leap. We appreciate the incredible value you're providing as a guide and are here to support you in any way we can. As a Level1 guide, you will change people's lives.
